# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This website is powered by **GitHub Pages** and hosted under the custom domain [sonumehta.online](https://sonumehta.online). It's a space where I showcase my work, share a bit about myself, and make my online presence known.

## Custom Domain Setup

This website is hosted on a custom domain (`sonumehta.online`). Hereâ€™s how I set it up:

1. In the root of this repository, I created a `CNAME` file and added my custom domain (`sonumehta.online`) inside it:
    ```text
    sonumehta.online
    ```

2. In my domain registrar's DNS settings, I added a **CNAME** record to point the subdomain `www` to `sonumehtaskr.github.io`, like so:
    - **Type**: CNAME
    - **Name**: `www`
    - **Value**: `sonumehtaskr.github.io`

3. Alternatively, for root domains like `sonumehta.online` without the `www`, I added **A Records** with GitHub's IP addresses:
    - **Type**: A
    - **Name**: `@` (root domain)
    - **Values**:
      - `185.199.108.153`
      - `185.199.109.153`
      - `185.199.110.153`
      - `185.199.111.153`

4. After DNS changes, I waited for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours).

5. I then enabled **HTTPS** under GitHub Pages settings for a secure browsing experience.
